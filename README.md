# aligncensus
Align data from the US Census databases with your own data, using geographic information available in both.

`python/aligncensus/manual_example.py` is presently what you want to look at - the rest is under development. The example notebook will show you how to build up a request to the US Census API, create a dataframe from the result, and then align that result with your own data in a new column.
